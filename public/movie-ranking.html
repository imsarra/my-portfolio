<h1>The Best Movies According to Sarah</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

<hr>

<h3>1. Synecdoche, New York (2008)</h3>
<p>My all-time favorite, I really enjoy Charlie Kaufman's work and how he deals with thems of death and the passage of time.</p>

<h3>2. In The Mood for Love (2000)</h3>
<p>A great piece by the great Wong Kar-Wai, he manipulates colors and music to share with the viewer this concept of taboo love <br>
We already know our two protagonasts (?) won't end up together, yet we still hold to that glimps of hope or just try to enjpy the ride while it lasts</p>

<h3>3. I'm Thinking of Ending Things (2020)</h3>
<p>Another beautiful film by Kaufman, it deals with similar themes to his 2008 feature but this one is a bit more abstract (I guess all his films are?) in the sense that we follow the story of a ganitor as he reflects on his "youth" through the eyes of an opportunity he never approched <br>
This guy is so misrable that even his mind could not give him the happy imagination of people acceptance ?? </p>
